# --- REFINED MAIN_USER_PROMPT (Focused on Core O&G Data) ---
MAIN_USER_PROMPT = """
Your critical task: Read the text below (delimited by triple backticks) and identify ALL Subject-Predicate-Object (S-P-O) relationships relevant to the **Physical Asset Management domain**. For EACH relationship, you MUST identify the TYPE for BOTH the subject and the object. Produce a single JSON array containing objects, where EACH object represents one S-P-O triple and MUST include ALL FIVE of the following keys: "subject", "subject_type", "predicate", "object", and "object_type".

Domain Context:
The text relates specifically to **Physical Asset Management**, focusing on **equipment tracking, maintenance operations, and facility management**. This includes concepts like:
- **Asset Data:** Equipment specifications, serial numbers, manufacturer information, installation dates, location assignments, condition status
- **Maintenance Data:** Work orders, inspection reports, preventive maintenance schedules, corrective actions, parts consumption, labor hours
- **Location Data:** Facility hierarchies (site → building → floor → room), geographic coordinates, asset placement, storage locations
- **Personnel Data:** Technicians, operators, inspectors, managers, contractors, certifications, assignments, responsibilities
- **Operational Data:** Equipment performance, utilization rates, downtime events, efficiency metrics, safety incidents
- **Supply Chain:** Parts inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, warranties, contracts, delivery schedules
- **Compliance:** Regulatory requirements, inspection schedules, certifications, safety protocols, environmental compliance
- **Entities:** Assets (Equipment, Machinery, Systems, Components), Locations (Sites, Buildings, Facilities), Personnel (Technicians, Operators, Managers), Organizations (Manufacturers, Suppliers, Contractors), Documents (Manuals, Reports, Procedures), Parts (Components, Materials, Tools), Measurements (Metrics, Readings, Specifications)

Follow these rules METICULOUSLY:

- **MANDATORY FIELDS:** Every JSON object in the output array MUST contain these exact five keys: `subject`, `subject_type`, `predicate`, `object`, `object_type`. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you cannot determine a specific type, use a reasonable default like "Asset", "Location", "Person", or "Document", but the key MUST be present.
- **Entity Consistency:** Use consistent, lowercase names for entities (e.g., "compressor unit 101" not "Compressor Unit #101", "preventive maintenance" not "PM"). Apply standard abbreviations where appropriate (e.g., "hvac" for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning).
- **Entity Types:** Identify the type for each subject and object using **Title Case**. Be specific to the Asset Management domain. Examples:
    - **Asset Types:** `Equipment`, `Machinery`, `System`, `Component`, `Infrastructure`, `Vehicle`, `Tool`, `Instrument`
    - **Location Types:** `Site`, `Building`, `Floor`, `Room`, `Area`, `Zone`, `Facility`, `Warehouse`, `Location`
    - **Personnel Types:** `Technician`, `Operator`, `Inspector`, `Manager`, `Contractor`, `Engineer`, `Supervisor`, `Person`
    - **Organization Types:** `Manufacturer`, `Supplier`, `ServiceProvider`, `Contractor`, `Operator`, `Company`, `Department`
    - **Document Types:** `Manual`, `Report`, `Procedure`, `Specification`, `Certificate`, `WorkOrder`, `Invoice`
    - **Maintenance Types:** `WorkOrder`, `Inspection`, `PreventiveMaintenance`, `CorrectiveMaintenance`, `Schedule`, `Task`
    - **Part Types:** `Component`, `SparePart`, `Material`, `Consumable`, `Tool`, `Inventory`
    - **Abstract Types:** `Measurement`, `Specification`, `Condition`, `Status`, `Priority`, `Cost`, `Date`, `Value`
- **Atomic Terms:** Identify distinct key terms. Break down complex descriptions if possible (e.g., "emergency shutdown system" might yield `(emergency_shutdown_system, is_type_of, safety_system)` and `(emergency_shutdown_system, located_in, control_room)`).
- **Handle Lists:** If the text mentions a list of items related to a subject (e.g., 'equipment including A, B, and C', 'technicians X, Y, Z assigned'), create **separate triples** for each item. Example: `(facility, contains_equipment, pump_a)`, `(facility, contains_equipment, compressor_b)`, etc.
- **Quantitative Data:** Extract specific metrics and link them to the relevant entity (e.g., `(pump_101, has_flow_rate, 500_gpm)`, `(motor_a, operating_temperature, 85_celsius)`, `(work_order_123, estimated_hours, 4.5_hours)`). Use predicates like `has_value`, `measures`, `operates_at`, `rated_for`.
- **CRITICAL PREDICATE LENGTH:** Predicates MUST be 4-6 words MAXIMUM, ideally 2-3 words. Be concise and use verbs. Examples: `located_in`, `manufactured_by`, `maintained_by`, `operates`, `contains`, `assigned_to`, `requires`, `scheduled_for`. Use lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`).
- **Completeness:** Extract ALL identifiable relationships relevant to the **physical asset management domain**.
- **Standardization:** Use consistent terminology (e.g., use "preventive maintenance" consistently, not "PM" or "planned maintenance").
- **Lowercase Values:** ALL text values for `subject`, `predicate`, and `object` MUST be lowercase.
- **No Special Characters:** Avoid symbols like %, @, ", ", °, etc., in values. Use plain text equivalents (e.g., "degrees c", "percent", "number").

Important Considerations:
- Precision in asset identification (equipment IDs, serial numbers, locations) is key.
- Maximize graph connectedness via consistent naming and relationship extraction.
- Consider the full context of maintenance operations and asset lifecycles.
- **ALL FIVE KEYS (`subject`, `subject_type`, `predicate`, `object`, `object_type`) ARE MANDATORY FOR EVERY TRIPLE.**

Output Requirements:
- Output ONLY the JSON array. No introductory text, commentary, or explanations.
- Ensure the entire output is a single, valid JSON array.
- Each object within the array MUST have the five required keys.

Example of the required output structure (Notice all five keys and domain relevance):

[
  {
    "subject": "compressor unit 101",
    "subject_type": "Equipment",
    "predicate": "located_in",
    "object": "building a",
    "object_type": "Building"
  },
  {
    "subject": "work order wo2024001",
    "subject_type": "WorkOrder",
    "predicate": "assigned_to",
    "object": "technician smith",
    "object_type": "Technician"
  },
  {
    "subject": "pump motor",
    "subject_type": "Equipment",
    "predicate": "manufactured_by",
    "object": "siemens",
    "object_type": "Manufacturer"
  },
  {
    "subject": "preventive maintenance pm101",
    "subject_type": "PreventiveMaintenance",
    "predicate": "scheduled_for",
    "object": "march 15 2025",
    "object_type": "Date"
  },
  {
    "subject": "temperature sensor",
    "subject_type": "Instrument",
    "predicate": "monitors",
    "object": "boiler temperature",
    "object_type": "Measurement"
  }
]

Crucial Reminder: Every single object in the JSON array must strictly adhere to having the `subject`, `subject_type`, `predicate`, `object`, and `object_type` keys. Ensure predicate is `snake_case`.

# --- NEW: Text-to-Cypher Prompt (with Fuzzy Matching for Entities & Relationships) ---
TEXT_TO_CYPHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Neo4j Cypher query translator. Your task is to convert natural language questions into precise Cypher queries based on the provided graph schema to retrieve relevant information.

Graph Schema:
{dynamic_schema}

Core Task:
1. Analyze the user's question (provided in the 'User Input' section below) to understand the specific information requested.
2. Identify the key entities (wells, fields, persons, companies, skills, software, etc.) and the desired relationship(s) mentioned or implied.
3. **Use Pre-linked Entities:** Check the 'Pre-linked Entities' section provided in the 'User Input'. This maps mentions from the question to canonical names found in the graph.
4. Construct a Cypher query that retrieves the requested information using the provided **Graph Schema**.
    - Use `MATCH` clauses to specify the graph pattern. Use specific node labels (e.g., `:Well`, `:Formation`, `:Skill`) from the schema if implied by the question (e.g., "Which wells...?").
    - Filter Entities: Use `WHERE` clauses for filtering on entity names:
        - **Priority:** If a 'Canonical Name in Graph' is provided for a mention in the 'Pre-linked Entities' section, **use an exact, case-insensitive match** on that canonical name: `WHERE toLower(node.name) = toLower('canonical_name_provided')`.
        - **Fallback:** If no canonical name is provided for a mention (shows as 'None' in the pre-linked list) or the entity wasn't pre-linked, use fuzzy, case-insensitive matching on the original mention from the question: `WHERE toLower(node.name) CONTAINS toLower('original_mention')`.
    - Filter Relationships:
        - If the question implies a specific action/relationship type (e.g., "who drilled", "where located", "what skills"), match the specific relationship type from the schema if known (e.g., `MATCH (a)-[r:DRILLED_BY]->(b)`). Relationship types in the schema are typically UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE.
        - **CRITICAL SYNTAX:** When matching multiple relationship types OR using a variable with a type, use the pipe `|` separator *without* a colon before subsequent types. Correct: `[r:TYPE1|TYPE2]`, `[:TYPE1|TYPE2]`. Incorrect: `[r:TYPE1|:TYPE2]`, `[:TYPE1|:TYPE2]`.
        - If the relationship is less specific or the exact type is unknown (e.g., "connection between", "related to", "tell me about"), match any relationship (`MATCH (a)-[r]-(b)`) and filter on the original predicate text using fuzzy matching: `WHERE toLower(r.original) CONTAINS 'keyword'`. Use keywords extracted from the question. (Note: `r.original` property stores the original text predicate).
    - Use `RETURN` to specify the output, using aliases like `subject`, `predicate`, `object` where appropriate for clarity. Return distinct results if needed (`RETURN DISTINCT ...`).
    - **Prioritize returning specific properties (like `.name`) rather than entire nodes.**
    - **DO NOT use the generic UNION query pattern unless the question is extremely broad like "show all connections for X".** Focus on targeted queries based on the question's intent and the schema.
5. If the question requires information directly from the source text, you can optionally include a match to the `:Chunk` node and return `c.text`.
6. If the question cannot be answered using the provided schema or is too ambiguous, return the exact text "NO_QUERY_GENERATED".
7. When matching variable-length paths like MATCH p=(e)-[r*1..3]->(x), the variable r represents a list of relationships. To access individual relationship properties like type or .original, you must use the path variable (e.g., p) with functions like relationships(p). For example: MATCH p=(e)-[*1..2]->(x) UNWIND relationships(p) AS rel RETURN type(rel), rel.original.

Query Formatting:
- Enclose the final Cypher query in triple backticks ```cypher ... ```.
- Only return the Cypher query or "NO_QUERY_GENERATED". Do not add explanations or comments outside the backticks.

REVISE_EMPTY_RESULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

You are an expert Neo4j Cypher query generator specializing in query correction. You are given a user question, a graph schema, and an initial Cypher query that returned zero results. The initial query has been evaluated as a `QUERY_MISMATCH`, meaning it likely failed to accurately capture the user's intent based on the question and schema.

**Graph Schema:**
{dynamic_schema}

**Your Task:**
Rewrite the original Cypher query to create a *revised* query that better aligns with the user's question and the provided schema.

**Revision Guidelines:**
1.  **Analyze Mismatch:** Identify the specific parts of the original query that likely caused the mismatch (e.g., wrong relationship type, incorrect node label, overly strict filtering on `name` property, wrong direction).
2.  **Reflect Intent:** Construct the revised query to target the entities, relationships, and properties implied by the user's question.
3.  **Consider Flexibility:**
    * If appropriate, make filters less strict (e.g., use `toLower(n.name) CONTAINS 'keyword'` instead of `toLower(n.name) = 'exact match'`).
    * If the relationship type was potentially wrong, try matching a more general pattern (`-[r]-`) and potentially filtering on `r.original` if keywords are available in the question.
    * Ensure the `RETURN` clause provides the specific information requested (e.g., return `entity.name` rather than the whole node).
4.  **Schema Adherence:** Ensure the revised query is valid according to the provided schema.
5.  **No Revision Case:** If, after careful analysis, you determine that the original query *was* the most plausible interpretation of the question despite returning no results, or if no meaningful revision seems possible to better capture the intent, then output the exact text `NO_REVISION`.
